      Kars is the leader of the Pillar Men, and the designer of the Stone Mask.
      His goal is to evolve further to become immune to the sun's rays, and thus
      he seeks the Red Stone of Aja to empower his Masks, battling the Ripple
      users for its possession.
    </p>
    <p class="flow-text">
      Initially, he appears to be the most aloof and no-nonsense of the Pillar
      Men, rarely smiling and often being the one who has to remind the other
      two of their ultimate objective. Obsessed with obtaining the Red Stone
      of Aja, he is willing to trample anyone in his way, no matter how
      dishonorable the method. At his worst, he broke his word about fighting
      for the Stone fair and square, cheating to defeat Lisa Lisa and then
      unleashing his Vampire minions to kill a weakened Joseph Joestar and has
      been revealed to execute children, anticipating their revenge.
